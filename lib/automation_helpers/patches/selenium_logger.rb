          UPDATE: 3/12/2024
          This patch should in theory be redundant now the root cause has been identified as a processing
          debugger fault in RubyMine. Since Ruby 3.2 this should no longer be an issue providing you are
          using an "up-to-date" RubyMine. I personally haven't encountered this issue for a couple of years

          As such this patch is now considered a deprecated patch with a 1 year TTL, at which point we'll then
          consider it for removal from the gem proper

          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          ORIGINAL ISSUE:
          When using the Selenium Logger that is set to pipe to a file, the Net::HTTP adapter (default),
          can return unencoded binary (confusingly called ASCII-8BIT in Ruby).
          Consequently we set the logger to binmode so it doesn't try to encode the data - this would always
          cause errors for non-ASCII characters, whatever the parent encoding is. An example of this is Â©.

          See https://github.com/ruby/net-http/issues/14 for a root cause analysis of the Adapter
