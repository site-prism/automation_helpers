        <<~DESCRIPTION
          When using the Selenium Logger that is set to pipe to a file, the Net::HTTP adapter (default),
          can return unencoded binary (confusingly called ASCII-8BIT in Ruby).
          Consequently we set the logger to binmode so it doesn't try to encode the data - this would always
          cause errors for non-ASCII characters, whatever the parent encoding is. An example of this is Â©.

          See https://github.com/ruby/net-http/issues/14 for a root cause analysis of the Adapter
